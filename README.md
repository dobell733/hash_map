# Hash Map (Open Addressing & Separate Chaining)

## Description
This repository contains files, that together, create open addressing and separate chaining hash map implementations. The open addressing hash map is contained in the file `hash_map_oa.py`. Similarly, the separate chaining hash map is contained in the file `hash_map_sc.py`. The `a6_include.py` file contains a `DynamicArray`, `SLNode`, `LinkedList`, and `HashEntry` class which were used to build both hash map implementations.

## Install
Feel free to fork and clone this repository for use on your local machine. Both the `hash_map_oa.py` and `hash_map_sc.py` files have tests at the bottom of the files that will run when the scripts are run locally. Feel free to utilize these tests to determine the accuracy of the program or tweak them for further testing.
